My implementation is an API that allows searching of food trucks, and filtering the results by location and/or freshness.

To run it:

go run .

Then using curl or a browser, issue requests like
http://localhost:8080/foodtrucks?lat=37.7921505484&lon=-122.39399&debug&search=cra

http://localhost:8080/foodtrucks?newest

http://localhost:8080/foodtrucks?search=pretzel

To run the unit tests:

go test .
